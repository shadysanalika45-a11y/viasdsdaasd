# Project V1 Map

## Overview
This document summarizes the updates applied in this iteration and highlights remaining gaps.

## Implemented Updates
- Added balance and transaction domain models (`Balance`, `Transaction`) and a `Video` model to track uploads and points.
- Created a `BalanceController` for client/creator balance screens and add/withdraw actions.
- Created a `VideoController` to award points on upload and list creator video points.
- Expanded `AdminController` to show balance/points stats and configure point settings.
- Added new balance and points dashboards:
  - `client-balance.blade.php`
  - `creator-balance.blade.php`
  - `creator-video-points.blade.php`
  - `admin-video-points.blade.php`
- Added Laravel Mix setup (`package.json`, `webpack.mix.js`) and wired `mix()` assets in the layout.
- Introduced global dashboard styling via `resources/css/app.css` and `resources/js/app.js`.

## Project Structure Map
- `app/Http/Controllers`
  - `Admin/AdminController.php`: Admin dashboard + video points settings.
  - `Dashboard/BalanceController.php`: Balance views + add/withdraw actions.
  - `Dashboard/ClientController.php`: Client dashboard overview.
  - `Dashboard/CreatorController.php`: Creator dashboard + offer/support/order status.
  - `Dashboard/VideoController.php`: Creator video uploads + points totals.
- `app/Models`
  - `Balance`, `Transaction`, `Video` (new), existing `Plan`, `Subscription`, `Payment`.
- `resources/views/dashboard`
  - `client-dashboard.blade.php`
  - `client-balance.blade.php`
  - `creator-dashboard.blade.php`
  - `creator-balance.blade.php`
  - `creator-video-points.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin`
  - `admin-dashboard.blade.php`
  - `admin-video-points.blade.php`
- `resources/css/app.css`, `resources/js/app.js`
- `public/mix-manifest.json`, `public/css/app.css`, `public/js/app.js`

## Missing / To Be Implemented
- Database migrations for `balances`, `transactions`, and `videos`.
- Integration with Laravel Cashier (no dependency configured yet).
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal) and secure OTP/email confirmation on balance operations.
- Real-time reporting for performance stats, campaigns, and invoice data.
- API endpoints for real-time balances/points updates.
- Admin CRUD screens for plan management if not already present.
- Production build pipeline for Laravel Mix (CI/CD step).

## Notes
- Current points and balance logic is implemented at controller level for the UI flow; once migrations and Cashier are added, logic should be updated to persist and validate properly.
- The layout now uses `mix()` helper; ensure `npm install && npm run dev` produces updated assets before deployment.
